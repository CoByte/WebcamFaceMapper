# WebcamFaceMapper
WebcamFaceMapper is a program designed to spice up your Covid-19 remote meetings, by mapping an image over your face. The program reads images from your webcam and uses machine learning software to track your face. It then maps a PNG over said face, using feature recognition to automatically scale it to fit. Finally, it streams out a new video as an MJPEG server, which can be used as a feed for a virtual webcam, such as [this](https://ip-webcam.appspot.com/) one. The program supports transparency, so you can use it to overlay masks on your head, replace you with a friend, and much more. And because it directly processes your webcam feed directly, there's no way for anyone but you to disable it. There's no limit to how far past rock bottom you can go with this software!
